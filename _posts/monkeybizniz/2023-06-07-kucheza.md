In collaboration with professor Gert van Dijk from Nyenrode Business University, this game was meant as a training to be used by farmers in Africa, to teach them about the advantages of joining a coöperation. The game would be used as part of a larger course, where the game is used as a simulation, to allow the farmers to experiment with various scenarios. Our prototype was eventually handed over to the professor, who founded a new company to finish the game and implement the training.

This game was built in the MonkeyEngine, for which Windows support was added to the engine, because the game was meant to be played on PCs. For us to rapidly protoytype, I also built a system that allowed us to specify lots of different scenario's, such as the order of in-game phases, events, unlockables, prices, etc, the game could play. The scenario's could be written in a simple XML format, which the game then read and played out accordingly.
