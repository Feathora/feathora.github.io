[Prik!](https://zorginnovatie.nl/innovaties/prik) is a simple game, meant to be played by young children in the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, to prepare them for having their blood drawn at the polyclinic and make them less scared. In the game, the children guide a small creature through the steps of drawing blood, so when the children eventually arrive at the doctor, they'll know what's coming and be more confident.

This game was written in the MonkeyEngine. It's a simple game, but for this we added Android support, support for multiple screen configurations in phone and tablet format, and because the game was to be released in Turkish as well, we added support for localisation and Unicode font characters.
