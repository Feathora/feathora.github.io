Due to my analytical nature, I'm always looking for opportunities to improve our curriculum. That's why, upon joining the Education Committee, my collegue described it as, 'it's what you do anyway, so we might as well make it official'.

Being part of this committee has given me a whole new interesting perspective on our school and organisation as a whole, due to having to work together with not just my fellow teachers, but also the director and course leaders. For example, whenever they want to make changes to the curriculum, it needs to be approved by the education committee. That means we need to think about what impact the change will have on all the students, on all the teachers, whether it's in line with the overall vision of the school, and whether it's in line with the official rules.
