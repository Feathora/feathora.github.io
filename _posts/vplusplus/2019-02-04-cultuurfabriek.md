As part of their exposition by the name of [VEXPO](https://www.bibliotheekveenendaal.nl/de-cultuurfabriek/vexpo.html), the Cultuurfabriek in Veenendaal has placed a big pillar with three screens in the middle of their entrace hall. Displayed on the screens are images and videos showing the history of Veenendaal. Next to the pillar is a touch screen, where visitors can select what they want to see on the pillar.

As an addition, I've built a website people can visit while at the Cultuurfabriek. Users are then face with a question about, for example, a memory of Veenendaal, and in response they can upload their own photo's to the screens, eventually making the pillar a reflection of the culture of Veenendaal.

The whole website is built in HTML, using the Laravel framework, with a backend in PHP. Images are stored in a MySQL database. There's also an Admin portal, where the people of the Cultuurfabriek can approve the uploaded images before they're shown on the screens, and where they can upload a new question for users to answer. The website itself can only be visited live at the Cultuurfabriek.
