 Sometimes a little bit of code can have a huge impact on someone. Vmoirs was such a piece of code. It's an app I made for a good friend of mine, when she was in a very bad place mentally. The app itself is simple enough. It's a list that holds quotes and memories, and you can add as many as you want. Every once in a while, every few hours for example, it shows a notification on your phone with a random memory from the list. And that's it. It's very simple, but these notifications turned out to be little bright moments in very dark times.

As for the technical side, it was a simple app made in Xamarin. A later added a small companion app, with which I could add new quotes and memories remotely, as random surprises. For that, it used an Azure Function as API, and Firebase for the remote Android notification.
